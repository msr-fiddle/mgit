    "Q2: Our research shows that the robustness of models, i.e. the ability to keep the model accuracy unaffected by noises added to the input, can be inherited from pre-training model, e.g. masked language modeling, to the down stream model, e.g. sequence classification. As a result, training a new version of ```distilbert-sentiment```, you can call it ```distilbert-sentiment_versioned```, from ```distilbert_v2``` will often lead to higher model accuracy on ```sst2_shifted_eval``` compared with the original ```distilbert-sentiment``` who is trained from ```distilbert```.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Imagine for the same data structure introduced previously where the training process to produce ```distilbert-sentiment``` from ```distilbert``` were recorded. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The data structure were to provide you an API to enable efficient training to produce ```distilbert-sentiment_versioned``` from ```distilbert_v2```, which conceptually look like:\n",
    "```py\n",
    ">>> #old_base is the reference node where the training process to produce its down stream models is recorded, and new_base is the new pre-training node that the recorded training process will be replayed on.\n",
    ">>> #new_target is fine-tuned from new_base and is returned as the next version of old_target \n",
    ">>> new_target_node = g.update_cascade(old_base=g.get_node('distilbert'), new_base=g.get_node('distilbert_v2'), old_target=g.get_node('distilbert-sentiment'))\n",
